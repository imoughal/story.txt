<h1>Fairy Tale</h1>
  
<p>Once upon a time there lived an old man up in the apalacian mountians 
  He was a grumpy old man for he had no family and was subjected to a life alone.
The only company he had was that of a old orange hued cat.
  
  The cat, for it was said, was a actually a diety sent to protect the old man from a formidable evil that roamed the lands.One day the old man had noticed that his little friend was acting strange. It seemed as if he was acting more and more daring.</p>
